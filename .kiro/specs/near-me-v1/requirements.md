# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Near Me is a location-aware reminder application that helps users complete context-sensitive tasks by delivering timely notifications when they approach, arrive at, or spend time at relevant locations. The app combines precision geofencing with persistent reminders to ensure tasks are completed without overwhelming users with notification spam. The core value proposition is "precision + persistence" delivered through a luxury, calm user experience with a freemium business model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Device Management

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using my device so that I can securely store my tasks and preferences across app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a unique device-based account
2. WHEN a user provides an email address THEN the system SHALL associate it with their device account for recovery purposes
3. WHEN a user reinstalls the app on the same device THEN the system SHALL restore their account using device identifiers
4. IF a user has an existing account THEN the system SHALL authenticate them automatically on subsequent launches

### Requirement 2: Core Task Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create location-based tasks with specific places or categories so that I can be reminded when I'm in the right context to complete them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify a title and optional description
2. WHEN creating a task THEN the user SHALL be able to associate it with either a specific place or a POI category
3. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL store it with default geofence radii based on the location type
4. WHEN a user views their tasks THEN the system SHALL display all active tasks with their associated locations
5. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL mark it as done and stop all related notifications
6. WHEN a user deletes a task THEN the system SHALL remove all associated geofences and stop notifications

### Requirement 3: Place and POI Category Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to define custom places and select from predefined categories so that I can create flexible location-based reminders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a custom place THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify a name and location via map selection or address search
2. WHEN a user selects a POI category THEN the system SHALL provide options for gas stations, pharmacies, groceries, banks, and post offices
3. WHEN a user creates a category-based task THEN the system SHALL find relevant POIs within a reasonable distance from their current or frequent locations
4. WHEN displaying places THEN the system SHALL show custom places and nearby category POIs with clear visual distinction
5. IF a user edits a place THEN the system SHALL update all associated tasks and geofences

### Requirement 4: Tiered Geofencing System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive escalating reminders as I get closer to relevant locations so that I have multiple opportunities to remember my tasks without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is associated with a category POI THEN the system SHALL create geofences at 5, 3, and 1 mile radii
2. WHEN a task is associated with home/work THEN the system SHALL create geofences at 2 miles, arrival, and 5 minutes post-arrival
3. WHEN a task is associated with other custom places THEN the system SHALL create geofences at 5 miles, arrival, and 5 minutes post-arrival
4. WHEN a user enters any geofence THEN the system SHALL trigger the appropriate notification type (approach, arrival, or post-arrival)
5. WHEN multiple geofences are triggered simultaneously THEN the system SHALL bundle notifications to prevent spam
6. WHEN a user is in a dense POI area THEN the system SHALL apply cooldown periods between notifications

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Notification System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive contextual notifications that persist until I complete my tasks so that I don't forget important errands even if I initially dismiss the reminder.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user approaches a location (5/3 mile geofence) THEN the system SHALL send a notification with format "You're {distance} from {place_or_category} — {task}?"
2. WHEN a user arrives at a location THEN the system SHALL send a notification with format "Arriving at {place} — {task} now?"
3. WHEN a user has been at a location for 5+ minutes THEN the system SHALL send a post-arrival notification with format "Still need to {task}?"
4. WHEN a notification is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide actions: Complete, Snooze (15m/1h/Today), Open Map, and Mute
5. WHEN a user snoozes a notification THEN the system SHALL respect the snooze duration before showing the next reminder
6. WHEN a user mutes a task THEN the system SHALL stop notifications for that specific task until manually re-enabled
7. WHEN the device is in Do Not Disturb or Focus mode THEN the system SHALL respect these settings and queue notifications appropriately

### Requirement 6: User Onboarding and Education

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be guided through the app's features and setup process so that I can quickly understand how to use location-based reminders effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL present a welcome screen explaining the core concept
2. WHEN proceeding through onboarding THEN the system SHALL show how the app works with visual examples
3. WHEN in the setup flow THEN the system SHALL present a questionnaire to understand user preferences and common locations
4. WHEN onboarding reaches permissions THEN the system SHALL request location and notification permissions with clear explanations
5. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL show a preview of how notifications will appear
6. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL present seed task examples and quick-add options for common scenarios

### Requirement 7: Premium Features and Soft Paywall

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access basic functionality for free while having the option to upgrade to premium features so that I can evaluate the app's value before committing to a subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL present a soft paywall with premium feature highlights
2. WHEN viewing the paywall THEN the user SHALL have options to start a trial or continue with free features
3. WHEN using the free version THEN the system SHALL limit users to 3 active tasks and basic notification options
4. WHEN a user starts a premium trial THEN the system SHALL unlock unlimited tasks, custom notification sounds, and advanced settings
5. WHEN the trial period ends THEN the system SHALL prompt for subscription conversion with clear pricing
6. IF a user chooses to remain free THEN the system SHALL continue providing core functionality with limitations

### Requirement 8: Privacy and Battery Optimization

2. WHEN tracking user behavior THEN the system SHALL use pseudonymous identifiers and respect privacy settings
3. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL monitor crash-free percentage, battery delta, false-positive rate, and disable rate
4. WHEN calculating business metrics THEN the system SHALL track onboarding completion, trial starts, conversion rates, and retention (D1/D7/D30)

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL continue geofence monitoring using cached POI data
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync pending events and task updates to the server
3. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and queue operations locally
