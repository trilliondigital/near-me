### Cross-Platform Consistency

#### Shared Flow Structure:
1. **Welcome** - App introduction and value proposition
2. **Concept** - How the app works with visual examples
3. **Permissions** - Location and notification access with privacy explanations
4. **Preferences** - Notification timing and quiet hours setup
5. **Locations** - Common places configuration (home, work, etc.)
6. **Categories** - Task type selection (shopping, health, finance, etc.)
7. **Preview** - Live demonstration of notification appearance
8. **Complete** - Success state with quick start suggestions and premium upsell

#### Consistent Features:
- Progress indicators showing completion percentage
- Back/Next navigation with validation
