## Common Questions
- Why do I need location permissions?
  - To trigger reminders near relevant places. You can choose foreground-only mode in Settings.
- How do I reduce notifications?
  - Use Mute or Snooze actions. The app also bundles and cools down reminders in dense areas.
- Battery usage seems high
  - Near Me uses significant-change and visits to minimize impact. If usage exceeds 3% daily, the app adapts automatically.
- Iâ€™m not receiving notifications
  - Check system notification permission and Focus modes. Ensure background location is enabled if you want geofences to trigger when the app is closed.
